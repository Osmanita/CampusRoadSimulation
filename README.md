# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: OPEN THE SCENE MANUALLY AFTER CLONE

Unity may open an empty scene on first launch.

Please open:
`Assets/Scenes/CampusSimulation.unity`



The processed source data used for terrain generation is located under the `Data/` directory.

The included RAW heightmap file is intentionally kept small (32 KB) and versioned directly in Git for ease of access and reproducibility.

The cropped satellite image, obtained by polygon masking in QGIS, is also provided in the same directory structure.
